# fCC Tic Tac Toe

> A freeCodeCamp Front-end Developer Challenge

The object was to build a working Tic Tac Toe game that was unbeatable. I opted to use VueJS for my framework and happened upon [Mariano Heller's](https://github.com/marianoheller/tic-tac-toe-minimax) excellent minimax plugin (reading through theoretical articles on game theory was fun but time consuming).

I spent a few minutes making some custom "nots" and "crosses" on my iPad, rolled them into a symbol, and added them.


## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build
```
